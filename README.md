# Kimus' dotfiles

My dotfiles. Minimalist, but helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a Mac, but I use some of these dotfiles on various linux servers, and they seem to be pretty flexible.

You may also be interested in my [MacOS from Scratch](https://github.com/kimus/macos-from-scratch) repository, which configures a new Mac from scratch and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.
